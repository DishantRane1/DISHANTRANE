The origin of FOSS gos back to the 1950s.When hardware was purchased , there used to be no additional charges for bundled software and the source code would also be availabe in order to fix possibe bugs in the software.
It was actually a common practice back then for users with the freedom to customize the code.
At that time, mostly academicians and resarchers in te industry were the collabrators to develop such software.
The term Open Source was not there yet. Instead the term that was poplar at that time was"Public Domain Software".As of today, ideologically,both are very much different in nature although they sound very much similar.
